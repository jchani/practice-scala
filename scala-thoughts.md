This was my first time programming in Scala and it was definitely quite challenging. What was most challenging was finding the 
Scala-y way of doign things. It was easy to resort to the imperative style of programming when I was unsure of how to approach
a problem. Once I realized the pattern-matching capabilities of Scala, I ended up using it in a lot of the problems. The 
functional style of programming gave me flashbacks to CS52 and SML. In terms of documentation, I found most of the resources 
were a little too long-winded and not example-oriented enough, and it was annoying to have to frequently look at documentation
but that's something that is part of the process of learning a new language. 

It was also interesting to see the higher-order functions like filter, map and fold. Originally to write the sumOfMany
function, I had tried to do some quite complex recursion, but then found the powerful function fold. These functions 
seem to be both a blessing and a curse as they can drastically reduce the number of lines to accomplish something, 
but lessens the need to understand the inner workings and intricacies of how things work. I can definitely see how it is a
language suited to build DSL's with because of how easy it is to add syntactic sugar.
